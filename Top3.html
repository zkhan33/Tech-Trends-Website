            <img class="image" src="./face recog.jpeg" alt="">
            <p>Facial recognition is now becoming the next big thing in technological devices. Iphone has
                implemented this invention back in 2017, for the release of the Iphone X. Since then, it's
                been
                added to multile other sorts of devices! It's set up with having your face in the center of
                the
                camera and moved all around in 360 degrees to get every angle. It then just unlocks once it
                recognizes your face. It basically is a substiture for a password and if you happen to
                forget
                your password, and facial recognition is set up, you can then unlock your device without any
                issues! </p>
